            <p><strong>Okay</strong>, so honestly I was going to make such a nice gallery of inspirational pictures of houseplant setups from people all over the internet. 

            <p>I admit, there are some amazing inspo photos that I have stashed away in one of my desktop folders.</p> 
        
            <p><strong>Who knows?</strong> Maybe I will obtain a job faster than I anticipated with my planning & maybe then, I can make have everything I need to have as many plants as I want!</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, as I mentioned above, I will be moving onto another part of my studies w/ development but may just come back to this eventually.</p>

            <p>Until then, take care!</p>
